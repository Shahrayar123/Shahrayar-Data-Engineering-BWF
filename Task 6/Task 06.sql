-- USE THE SAME DATABASE:

-- 1. Write a query to retrieve all orders placed by customers, 
-- 	including customer details (name, phone), order details 
-- 	(order ID, timestamp), and item details (product, amount).

-- 2. Write a query to fetch all products along with their 
-- suppliers' details (name, phone) and the corresponding category name.

SELECT products.name AS "Product Name",
